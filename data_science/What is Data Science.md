## What is Data Science?
**Data science** is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, computer science, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data at small and large scales. 

### The Data Science Process:

### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
Data rarely starts out in the format, standard, or schema that we need it in.  The first step for a data scientist (after project management) includes researching the correct schemas and data types to answer your question and moving the data into that format

 1.  **Research** previous existing tools and data pipelines that apply to your scale, problem, and available data types
 2.  **Plan** out how your data will flow into your methodology and which software and system req uirements you'll need to accomplish this
 3.  **Execute** iterative data analysis methods
 4.  **Evaluate** the validity of your data sources
 
#### Key concepts: 
 - **Scale**: 
 - **Data Type**: 
 -  **Data Validation**: 

### Data Analysis
Next you'll use the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) to visualize descriptive and inductive characteristics of your data and identify algorithms that accurately and reliably predict future data points.
