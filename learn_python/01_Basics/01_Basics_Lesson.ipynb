    "If you have never thought of programming before, never made an `if-then` formula in excel, never looked under the hood at HTML code in a webpage you may be wondering \"Why do Learn to program?\" All of the programming concepts these links teach you are tools on a tool belt; but in order to know what those tools are for you need to understand what the end product we're trying to build looks like.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, this site from Microsoft will teach you those concepts by showing you the logic used to build arcade games. I recomend building a few games first before diving into these if you have never programmed before:\n",
