    "### Choosing Probability Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "**probability distributions** are  mathematical function that predict the likelyhoods of occurrence of different possible outcomes for an experiment. Different experiments and types of events have different distributions because the probability changes based on natural causes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Distributions are usually visualized one variable at a time (1-dimensional) with histograms\n",
